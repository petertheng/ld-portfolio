    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      As a seasoned educator transitioning into corporate Learning & Development,
      I bring a decade of experience in designing engaging, outcomes-driven learning
      experiences. My background in science education has equipped me with a deep
      understanding of how to translate complex concepts into accessible,
      actionable knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      My instructional philosophy is grounded in active learning, inquiry-based
      strategies, and real-world application. I design with the learner in mind—
      ensuring each solution is aligned with measurable goals, incorporates
      multimodal engagement, and supports retention and performance in diverse
      environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hold a Master of Education in Educational Leadership and specialize in
      instructional design, digital learning integration, and performance evaluation.

    <h2>Sample Project: Anatomy & Physiology Curriculum Design</h2>

    <h3>Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      The school lacked an established Anatomy & Physiology course. No standardized
      resources, assessments, or content existed for either Honors or Non-Honors tracks.
    </p>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Used ADDIE and Bloom's Taxonomy to design a comprehensive curriculum</li>
      <li>Developed real-world case studies and project-based learning modules</li>
      <li>Created hands-on labs including dissections and research-based assignments</li>
      <li>Implemented digital tools for assessments and engagement</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tools Used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Canvas, Google Slides, Nearpod, YouTube Studio</li>
      <li>Kahoot, Gimkit, Edpuzzle, Google Docs/Sheets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Role</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Defined learning objectives aligned with standards</li>
      <li>Created multimedia content and authentic assessments</li>
      <li>Facilitated collaboration and peer learning</li>
      <li>Used data analytics to iterate and improve instruction</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>
      Students scored 8–12% higher than district averages on the final exam over
      a 9-year period, with significantly increased learner engagement and achievement.
