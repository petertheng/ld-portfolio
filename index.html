    <h2>Sample Project: Anatomy & Physiology Curriculum Design</h2>
    <h3>Challenge</h3>
    <p>The school lacked an established Anatomy & Physiology course. No standardized resources, assessments, or content existed for either Honors or Non-Honors tracks.</p>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Used ADDIE and Bloom's Taxonomy to design a comprehensive curriculum</li>
      <li>Developed real-world case studies and project-based learning modules</li>
      <li>Created hands-on labs including dissections and research-based assignments</li>
      <li>Implemented digital tools for assessments and engagement</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tools Used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Canvas, Google Slides, Nearpod, YouTube Studio</li>
      <li>Kahoot, Gimkit, Edpuzzle, Google Docs/Sheets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Role</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Defined learning objectives aligned with standards</li>
      <li>Created multimedia content and authentic assessments</li>
      <li>Facilitated collaboration and peer learning</li>
      <li>Used data analytics to iterate and improve instruction</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>Students scored 8–12% higher than district averages on the final exam over a 9-year period. Significantly increased learner engagement and achievement.</p>
