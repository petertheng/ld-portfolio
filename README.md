# Canvas LMS Instructional Design Case Study
## Anatomy & Physiology – Blended Learning Course

This repository documents the instructional design, development, and
implementation of a Canvas LMS course created to support blended learning
through structured online instruction and hands-on laboratory experiences.

---

## Project Overview

**Audience:** High school students (Grades 11–12)  
**Delivery Format:** Blended learning (in-person labs + asynchronous online modules)  
**Platform:** Canvas LMS  
**Role:** Sole instructional designer, content developer, and facilitator

## The Challenge

Students were required to master complex biological concepts while
participating in hands-on lab activities such as dissections and experiments.
The course needed to provide clear structure, flexible access to content, and
strong alignment between instruction, labs, and assessments.

---

## Instructional Design Approach

- Modular course architecture to reduce cognitive load
- Learning objectives aligned to assessments and lab activities
- Scaffolded content progression from foundational to applied concepts
- Integration of formative and summative assessments
- Intentional use of LMS tools to promote active learning

---

## Engagement & Experiential Learning

- Hands-on laboratory activities (including dissections)
- Pre-lab and post-lab Canvas activities
- Formative quizzes and reflection prompts
- Performance-based assessments

---

## Assessment & Evaluation

- Low-stakes formative assessments
- Performance-based lab assessments
- Unit exams aligned to stated learning objectives
- Use of LMS analytics to identify learning gaps and adjust instruction

---

## Artifacts Included

- Screenshots of course modules and assignments
- Sample lesson outlines and assessment materials
- Documentation of instructional design decisions

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Canvas LMS  
- Google Workspace  
- Multimedia and interactive learning tools
